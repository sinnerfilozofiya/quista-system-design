This document contains the initial system design for our project. The image provided is intended to offer a basic and foundational overview of the system architecture and components involved. It serves as a starting point for understanding the layout and interaction between different parts of the system.

Please note that this design is in its early stages and may undergo significant changes as the project evolves. It is meant to guide initial discussions and development efforts.
